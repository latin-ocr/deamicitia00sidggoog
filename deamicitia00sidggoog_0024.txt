“ ’ best of the philosophers (13); and so did Scipio:
whose soul is then more happy in his new life? (14) ln
any case it is a great consolation to think of our
friendship (ις)

ra. and scaev.—Please talk about friendship (16).
v. tute-I would is Ι had the power: it is the nrost
precious human treasure. Only good men can really
ha've friendship3 and by ‘good' Ι don't mean the
philosophers ideal good, which does not exist in
real life, but men who show good qualities (18-19).
Nature has implanted a certain sympathy‚ greater as
the bond is closer ; but friendship making its selection
out os the whole world is much rnore powerful (2ο).

vi. Friendship is the best gift of the gods, next towisdom:
if you count virtue the summum bonum, virtue is the
base of friendship (21). Friendship covers the whole
of life (22).

vii. Friendship keeps up our hopes and energies, defles
absence, poverty, even death. Goodwill is the hond of
society (23); nay, Empedocles explained even the
combinations of nature, by referring them to love l It ’
appeals to every heart: witness the applause in the
theatre at the devoted love of Pylades and Orestes l (24).

renum—Please go on.
scaevola—Nou can plead the cause of friendship as
well as you did that of justice (25).

viii. mealtune-What is the origin of friendship? Not
interest, sor the friendship that rests on that is often
hollow‚ but nature ; and it is seen in beasts as well as
men (26-27). Virtue in another is naturally attractive

ix. (28). To derive it from interest is to degrade it (29),
and would make the most deficient men the best
friends, which is absurd (30). Such a doctrine is
worthy os the Epicuream, and sails to account sor the
permanence of friendship, which outlives mere interest
(32). Do you agree?

ι’. and ⁵.-Yes.
