lived so long at Athens as to earn the name Atticus, or ‘ tho
Athenian! Amid the unhappiness, perplexities, and vacil-
lations of Cicero's public life, it is pleasant to think of the
constant affection which united him to Atticus, and the great
solace it was to him. The correspondence between them
(of which 396 letters from Cicero to Atticus are preserved)
lasted from rac. 68 to 44, with but few gaps of any length3
and is one of the most interesting and instructive memoriale
of antiquity.

§3.—SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE.

The essay on Friendship is thrown into the form of a
dialogue3 and the circumstances he explains to his readers
in the dedication to Atticus, which is prefixed to the work.

He says that he remembers‚ when quite young, hearing
Q. Mucius Scaevola the augur, who was son-in-law of
Laeliae, relate to him a conversation about friendship‚ held
some forty years before between Laelius and his two sons·
in-law‚ Scaevola himself, and Fannius. The occasion on
which Scaevola repeated this conversation was ῐι propos of
the rupture between two persons who had been great friends,
Sulpicius Rufus and Q. Pompeius, in the year 88. Cicero
was then a youth of 18. The conversation itself is supposed
to have taken place ‘a few days after the death of Scipio .
Africanus,' zie. in 129. Cicero, writing in 44, professes to
remember ‘the drift,' or ‘thoughts' of this dialogue‚ ss
reported by Scaevola ; but to have dramatised it, in order to
make it less tiresome to the reader. lt is pretty clear that
there is more of Cicero than of Laelius in this treatise.
Laelius spoke of friendship in 129. Forty=one years latet
Scaevola related the dialogus to Cicero. Fortyfour
years later again Cicero dramatises it for Atticus and the
world.

ln many of his philosophical works Cicero adopts the
dialogue form, no doubt in imitation of Plato. The imitation
is, however, a good way from the original. lt is not merely
that Plato is a consummate master of irony, playfulness‚
