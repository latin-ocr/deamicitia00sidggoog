PREFACE

The chief pointsI have given at the end of the notes.
Mai’s edition of the ‘Republic’ has been useful lor the
speakers in the dialogue and the Scipionic circle 3 and
Watson sor the facts about Cicero, and the dates of his
compositions. ι

Ι have endeavoured to profit by recent improvements
in the accuracy os Latin spelling, to which increasing
attention has been paid in England ever since Mr. Mnnro
’ published his Lucretius. On this head Iowe thanks to an
excellent little edition of Cicero's ‘Pro Archia’ published
⁴ by Mr. J. S. Reid, os Christ’s College‚ Cambridge
·1t is scarcely necessary to mention such works as
Middleton's‘Cicero,’andMommsen's‘HistoryofRome’:
« the latter of which I have consulted constantly.
