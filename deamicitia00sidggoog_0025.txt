LAELIUS DE AMICITIA

x. Then hear Scipio’s views: He thought friendship
liable to many dangers, divergence of interest and
opinion (33), competition for marriage connexion or
honours (34), or demand for some dishonourable ser·
vice (35); eg. traitors' friends clearly ought to refuse
aid (36). Blossius of Cumae was plainly wrong in
saying he would have followed Gracchus in setting

lire to Rome (37). The best men do not ask any dis-
graceiul service ; but you cannot lay down a rule that
a man should follow bis friend, human wisdom being
imperfect (38-39).

xii. Friends therefore must refuse shameful service 3 and
the rule is all the more needful as the times are dan-
gerous (4o41). Themistocles ancl Coriolanus found
no supporters (42-43)·

xiii. True friendship demands therefore a high code of
duty (44). The idea os certain sophists, that it is safer
to love but little, and so be free from care, is low (45) ;
or that friendship is due to weakness‚ requiring aid

emotion is to be a stock and stone (47-48). Virtue is
the cement of friendship (49). The good have a
natural attraction for each other (50). The 'delight is
the love itself, not the mere gain of aid-nay, friend-
ship is evoked by rendering service, not receiving
them (51). The wealthiest and most powerful tyrants
have fewest friends; ag. Tarquin (52-53). Prosperity
is even a bar to friendship, as leading to arrogance

Ἴ (54). They desire luxury only, and end in being friend-
less and miserable ( 5 5).

xvi. How far is love to go: Not(¹) love your friend as
yourself : many acts are done ‘for friends which no one
would do for himself (56-57). Nor(²) love as you are
loved : such measurement of affection is foreign to the
spirit of friendship (58). N or (³) measure out your love

. according to your friend's estimare: often he is too
diffident. Nor(⁴), as Bias said, ‘Love as though you
