would one day hate, ae. with reserve (59); rather
never begin a friendship which is likely to end (60).
xvii. Let union with good friends therefore be complete,
even stretching a point to please them, but avoiding
grave wrong (61). Be careful in the selection-—Scipio 2
complains of the little care men give-and since you
must be friends first before you can test a man (62), let

friendship begin moderately; and try him in various ’

ways. Money is a good test, ambition a severe one
xviii. Prosperity and adversity are both good tests (64). A
fn'end should be trusty, and not suspicions (65).

xire Also gentle and kindly (66). Old friends are the best
(67). Not that new ones should be abjured; but old
associations are justly strong (68). Ahove all, a friend
should be on footing of equality with his humbler
friends (69): confer aid and honour on them (70).

xx. So the humbler should accept their inferiority: and
avoid expostulating or claiming credit (75).Ι And

- the great should help on the humbler (72), according

to the capacity of each (73). Childislv friendships

. constitute no obligation to remain friends, on the prin·

ciple that friends must have like interests, though

they should not 66 rudely dropped (74). Α weak com-
plaisance must be resisted (7 5).

xxi. Friends must sometimes be dropped, gendy, if pos-
sible (76). lf changes make it necessary, it should be
done, but gradually ; and never turn to active hos·
tility (7778). Choose slowly‚ and choose worthily: a

¹ worthy friend is rare; but most men fail, from having
only sels-interest at heart (79). You should love your
friend for his own sake (80): even beasts want com·
rades ; and how much more men l (81).

rodi ln addition to all the other mles, friends should respect κ

each other (82), and so he helpers in virtue, not
partners in vice (83): 56 we should attend to virtue

(84), and not find out our mistake when too late {18 5).
