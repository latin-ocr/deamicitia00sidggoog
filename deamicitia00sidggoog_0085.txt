MELIUS aa halama nc, 41

0. Papirius Gerbo, an energetic and able adherent of Ti.
GracchuS, who, after his death, wasone of the distributors cf
the lands under his agrarian law. He was tribune of the plebs
in 131 B.C., but shortly aster changed sidae, and aster ener-
getically opposing C. Gracchus, was attached by the demo-
1111ξᾶ and, being deserted by his new friends, committed
su1c1 e.

Ο. Cato, grandson cf Cato the Censor (see Introd. Sabiona
circle), consul 114 nc. r little else is known of him.

minimatum cuidem. C. Gracchus was doubtless a sym·
pathiser all along in his brother's proJects, but did not take
a prominent part in politics till after lns brother's death. He
was, however, then appointed a member of the commission
to carry out 'liberius' agrarian law, and so Laelius sayS,
‘nunc quidem acerrimae, speaking, it must be remembered,
in 129. [It is not therefore necessary to suppose, with
Madvig, that Cic. means minime acer, and not nrinitne seqre·
batur: which would anyhcw be a harsh construction]

idem, idiomatic Latin use, when contrasting two points in the
same person r we should say ‘now on the contrary.'

40. spano curriculoque, ‘the caune and track‚' metaphor from

racrng.

41. regnum occupare conatus, ‘tried to make himself king,'
the regular aristocratic accusation against popular leaders
It was probably true, that any efficient reform could only be
carried against the senate by one man making himself practi-
cally despot through the popular support: and Mommsen's
view is that T i. Gracchus tried the resona without seeing
where he was going, but that C. Gracchus did aim at such a
practical despotism, taking the form of a pennanent tribune·
ship through constant re·e1ection hythe people.

amici et propinqui, see 12. Here he distinctly charges the
democrats with the assassination cf Scipio.

Others refer this tc P. Scipio Nasica Serapio [seePedigree cf
Scipios], consul 138, who, in 133 no, led the senate tc the
attack against Tiberius Gracchus (his cousin) and the mob;
in which attack and the consequent confusion Tiberius was
killed. Nasica became so odious for this that he was
(Ιεῗραὶῐοὲεά tc Asia, nominally cn a mission, really to get him ’
ou o t eway.

'But it is highly improbable that Laelius would referto him
without further distinction: and Laelius, as a moderate,
would scarcely be so devoted to the violent Nasica ; and in
any case lns fate was not such that ‘it would not be men· =
t1oned without tears.'
