virtuous Roman: a lashion sor which there was doubtless
some ground, but which was carried to extremes, from political

motives, by the senatorial partisans and especially by Cicero.

ι In his old age-his temperanee and splendid constitution

enabled him to live to 85 (see § 5)—he became somewhat
sostened, and even tras brought into a certain connexion
with the Scipios by the marriage of his son with Aemilia, the
sister of Africanus. So Cicero, in the dialogue ‘De Senec-
tute,' chooses him as the type oi noble old age, and makes
the conversation on that subject be carried on by Cato,
Scipio, and Laelius. It is related that at last he modificd
his hatred of Greek literature, and consessed that Homer
and Demosthenes were worth reading·; though to the end
he was a bitter opponent os Greek influence, ol higher
culture, and of luxury in all sonns.

Cato is referred to in ‘De Amicitia,' §l 4, 5, 6, 9, rr, 21, 90, ἵ

ῙΟΙ.
