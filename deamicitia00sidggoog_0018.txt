INTRODUCTION

Gracchus was still, however, in force: and at first Scipio

’ helped to get it efficiently administered. Later, in 129, he

thought it had gone far enough, and mainly through his'
influence it was shelved.' A few days later, after agraet day
Ι (i 12) when Scipio had been escorted home by large crowds
of senators and Latius, lte was found dead in his bed. He
was murdered, most probably by some enraged democrat
u 12241l·

Not merely was he ‘ the first general and statesman of his
age’ (Momms. iii. 104), but, himself a man of the highest
culture and no mean orator, he gathered round him a most
remarkable society of men of thought and men of letters.

meeum-The eldest of the group was Laelius himself,
whose friendship with Scipio Cicero constantly mentions as
an illustrious example of what friendship should be. He was
rather the elder of the two (ξ 15), being born about 190. ln
146, Laelius fought under Scipio in Africa, and was praetor
145, consul 140 (i 96). He distinguished himself against
Viriathus in Spain in 145. He was, however, morea man
of thought than action, and was devoted to philosophy, being
an adherent of the Stoic school. In politicS, he plainly fol·
lowed Scipio. ’

There are also the two younger speakers in the dialogue,
Scaevola and Fannius, sons-in-law of Laelius, and both
speakers in the dialogue ‘De Republica)

scaevae-Quantus Mucius Scaevola, the Augur (who
mtrst be carefully distinguished from the younger and greater
Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the Pontifex Maximus, probably
his cousin's son: both being mentioned here in§ 1). He

· was learned in the law, and published some books on the ’

subject : so is always spoken of with respect.

saturnu-catus Fannius is mentioned by Cicero as the
author of a not inelegant history, and is praised for his gift

of expression. Not much is known about him. He was the
elder of the two sons-in-law (Amicit. § 32).
