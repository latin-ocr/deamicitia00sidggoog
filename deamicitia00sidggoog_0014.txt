- INTRODUCTION.

§ 1.-TlME AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ·
DlALOGUE.

The ‘De Amicitia’ was written ¹in lte. 44,'a few months
after the assassination'of Julius Caesar. Cicero had joined
Pornpey before Pharsalia, and after the overthrow of the
Pompeian party had been pardoned by Caesar and returned
to Rome. F inding not much further scope fo'r his oratorical
abilities in the senate or courts, and no further political
work or scheming open to him, now that the ‘condition of
the country' (to use his own words, Nat. Deor. i. 4, 7) ‘was
such that it had to be guided by the diligence ond judgrnent
of one man,’ he betook himself to the, composition of works
on philosophical subjects and literary essays The rapidity
with which he worked (even if we admit, as we must, that
the philosophical value of these writings is not great, and

, that most of the lighter treatises are but dull reading), is still
most extraordinary. ln this last year but one of his life (he
was killed by order of Antony in December 43), he wrote
besides lesser works the ‘De Natura Deorum‚' the ‘De '
Divinatione,' ‘De Gloria,’ ‘De Officiis,’ ‘De Senectute,' ‘De
Amicitia,' a large number of letters, and the first four
Philippic speeches against Antony 3 and he finished and pub·

lished the long dialogue called the Tusculan Disputations.

that subject. He suasa Roman eques of Cicero's own age,
