LAELIIIS DE AMICITIA

Polybius, the gifted Greek historiam who came, 167, as
one of a thousand Achaean hostages sent to Rome. Scipio,
then 18 years old, got leave for Polybius to live at his father’s
house, and became his intimate friend. The Greek lived
17 years nt Rome, and accompanied Scipio on ull his expe-
ditions. He is, however, not mentioned in the ‘De Amicitia)

’bitum-Younger than Scipio was L. Furius Philus (§ 14,
69, ποι). He was consul 136, see note on ξ 14. He was
like the rest a cultivated man, is said by Cicero (Brut. 28) to
have been ‘an excellent speaker, remarkable lor the purity
ol his style ;' and from the ‘De Republica' we leam that
he was acquainted with astronomy. Like Laelius, he isone
of the speakers in the ‘ De Republica?

flammineSpurius Mummius (§ 69, ποι), the brother
oi L. Mummius, the conqueror of Corinth, was a student

of Stoicism, and a man (says Cicero) of moderate eloquence. κ

From Cicero (Art. xiii. 6) we learn that he wrote amusing
verses, He is also a speaker inthe ‘De Republica'

'rubero-Q. Aelius Tubero, nephew ol Scipio by his
sister Aemilia, a Stoic philosopher, and learned in the law.
Cicero (Brut. 31) says he was a manos strict life (severus),
inferior as a speaker, but learned in philosophy. He also
calls him a ‘man of principle and character' (fortis et
constans), by which he probably means a firm supporter of
the nobility. He is mentioned here (§ 37 and 101)'as a friend
of Laelius-from his early youth, and an opponent of Ti.
Gracchus. He, again, is one of the company in the ‘De
Republica' and was clearly one ol the younger members of
the circle. (See also Pedigree of the Scipios, p. xvii.)

P. Rutilius Rufus, called by Laelios (§ 101) ‘a very young
man! He was evidently a very cultivated man, learned in
the law and in philosophy, an orator and writer. He was
also a man of firm and incorruptible character (see note on
