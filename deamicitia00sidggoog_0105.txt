To the student of Latin nothing is more important in the whole
Syntax than to understand thoroughly the various uses of the
subjunctive. And there is no writer more instructive on this point
than Cicero; inasmuch as, his style being 'at once delicate and
precise, expressing a variety ol fine shades oi meaning, witha
copious resource of torm as well as vocabulary, his prose is a very

storehouse of subjunctives.

It would be very little use to givea general theory of the sub·
junctive, presented in a ‹lefinition consisting ol abstract terms. 'l'o
the begiuner it would be meaningless; to the scholar probably
superfluous. The first thing is caresully to classisy theores, until
they become familiar, and the object ol this scheme is to enable the
learner to do so, with the subjunctives in this book, and so to learn
to discriminate the uses generally. It would be quite possible to
geta wide and accurate knowledge ot' this department of syntax
srom the De Amicitia only.

There will be doubtless nrany who read this edition to whom such
classification is already familiar. These can easily omit this sec·
tion. But considerable teaehing experience leads me to think there
will be more to whom it may be of use.
