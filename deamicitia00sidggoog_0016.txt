variety, and vivacity of dialogue, infact, a dramatic writer of
the highest genius ; and that Cicero is neither humorous nor
dramatic. But in Plato the interchange of question and
answer‚ and the investigation of trutlr by that means, is the

very essence of the Socratic method. Somebody states or

detines something; and the truth is then found, or rather
sought‚ by crass-examining this statement or definition* ln
Cicero it is quite otherwise. The dialogue is a mere artificial
setting. The interlocutors are lay-figures, who make a few
remarks at the beginning, or in the pauses : while the main
disquisition soon falls into the hands of the leading per-
sonage, who delivers a long harangue on the subject, and
ends with a peroration.

The merits of the ‘De Amicitia,' as of all Cicero’s philo-
sophie works or essays, lie mainly in the style. Cicero .
founded the ‘ Latin prose style :' and the treatise before us
is a good example of it. The treatment of his subject may
be not very original or profoundt but the style is varied, and
easy, and bright; and the expression all through is marked
by the orator's rich and discriminating vocabulary, his neat-
ness of structure, his balance of period, and his delicate ear
for sound. It is for these reasons chiefly that Cicero has been
read so much : and for these reasons he deserves, and will
doubtless continue, to be read.

‘ Discourses ol this kind,' says Cicero (Amic. i. 4), ‘seem
somehow to come with more force when they are put into
the mouth of distinguished men of old times ;’ and it will be
well to give a short account of the extremely distinguished
company, of whom Laelius was one, and who were gathered

⁴* It is true that in the later dialogues the dramatic element
becomes very secondary: they are no longer a search for truth, but
an exposition of a system. But this does not make the case for
Cicero any better. If he was to imitate Plato, why not Plato at his

best?
