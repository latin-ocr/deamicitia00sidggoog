LAELIUS DE AMICITIA

§6.—CONSPECTUS OF THE DlALOGUE.

To assist the less advanced reader,1 bave thought it better
to give both a conspectus and an analysis ol the dialogue.
The first gives a detailed sketch oi the matter: and the

friendship, being himself a true friend ; and with equal
appropriateness 1 dedicate the dialogue to you (4-5).
