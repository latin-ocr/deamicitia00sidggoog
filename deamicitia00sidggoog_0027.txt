'LAELIIIS DE AMICITIA

xxiii. Opinions differ about what is desirable: all agree
that friendship is so (86). Even misanthropes require
society z and all luxuries, with solitude, would be only
misery (87). Even the beatific vision would be nothing
if seen alone (88).

xxiv. Offence shouldbe avoided ; though it shouldbe saced
when needful to warn a friend (88). Truth may give
offence3 but it is his iault who takes offence (89) 3 he
is offended at the wrong thing, not his error, but his

, friend's remonstrance (90).

xxv. Flattery is the worst bane of friendship (91) ; it saps
the union and simplicity os the bond (92). What more
fickle than a parasite? (93).Ι Still worse isan influ-
ential man aetinga parasite's part (94). A flatterer
can be discerned however with care (95). Instances oi

even the mob detecting and repudiating their flatterer's

(96)-

xxvi. How much greater must the power of truth be in
friendship! (97). It is the vain and insincere who

chiefly listen to flattery (98), though eve'n others may

be in danger from it (99).

more‚notinterest(1oo). Instances of friendship between
persons of equal and unequal age (101). The value
and permanenee of his friendship with Scipio (102-

104).
