Two other remarkable men are mentioned as friends of
Scipio τ though one died when Scipio was a youth, the other
was ayouth when Scipio died. Neither of them is men-
tioned here.

warenae, usum-The poet P. Terentius Aser uas a
Carthaginien slave who was educated and freed by his
master, and took to writing comedies. His first play exciteti
the admiration of Scipio (who was ten years younger, a boy
of¹ 17), and Terence became a friend of him and of Laelius.
But the friendship only lasted a few years, as Terence left
Rome, and died at the age of 36. His six comedies are
ertant3 and he is quoted here ln ξ 89, and again §93.

ventor of satire, orat least the first Roman satirist ol mark,
well-known by Horace's references to him as aroughnnd·
ready composer and unsparing in censure. He is said to
hare been an intimate friend of Laelius and Scipio, but it
must be borne in mind that hc was only 19 when Scipio
died at the age of 56.

orror-A word must be said finally about the great Cato,
though he died uc. 149, at the age of 85, when Scipio tvae
only 36, and though he had quarrelled so desperately with .
the elder generation ol Scipios, that he can hardly ttt any
time have been much of a f'rlend to the younger. He tras in

firm supportet of the ulti Roman republican ideal-a state of

been ol old, lt had clearly become untenable when Rome hed
entered on het career of conquest. Cato traced much or the
evil tendencies of the day to Greek customs and influencc
os Greek literature and thought; and his attack on all
luxury and ‘un-Roman manners' as he thought them began

and unsparing persistency through his remarkable censorship.

ln aster years, it was the fashion to regard Catoas the typical
