NOTES ΟΝ THE READINGS.

26. quod qnisnn'nns: so P. : Madv„ Baiter, and Halm read qaer'sqae.
⁸ quis makes perlectly good sense.

32. ab his, Baiter with the MSS. Halm, Madv. , read nt ii.
46. putentur, P. Halm, Baiter, Madv, putamur.

49. animante, P. and Baiter. Halm and Madv. read artenao autent,
bnt the strange word animante is more liable to get altered:
and autem is not so good in such an antithesis as there is no
connexron.

53. exsedanltena tnnc is Madvig’s neat correction sor the clumsy tum
exsn aaran.

55. quod etiam si is Lahmeyer's correction sor the MSS. ut etiarn
si, which does not make sense.

57. cansa criticorum is the MSS. reading adopted by Halm: it is
ngly certainly, but perhaps felt to bc necessary by the writer
after anostra, to which ann'cornrn simply would not be a
perfect antithesis.

70. consecuti sint. P. and Baiter: Halm ancl Madv. read sinn.
The subj. is quite natural, and we had better follow the

best MS.

duxerint, again P. r Madv, Halm, and Baiter read drcxannt.
Again the subj. is quite right: see notes.

86. a natatilis. The MSS. insert belore this qnancquam, which is not
sense, and so Madv. and Baiter omit it.

88. sananda, Facciolati’s correction adopted by Madv. sor snbla· ι
vanda,· see notes '

99. nrtunxais, Bentley’s emendation adopted by Madv. The MSS.
have nt iusseris ; corrupt plainly.

100. ductum, P. Baiter. Madv. and Halm read dz'ctnm, which is
perhaps commonet sor ‘derived ;' but dantum will do.

104. affini. P. Madia, Baiter, and Halm read affimat, which is not
necessary though natural: sce notes
